# Introduction

These are the materials for *How to Create Publication-Ready Tables in R*, a short course taught at UseR! 2022 on Monday, June 20<sup>th</sup> 2022, 2:00 - 5:30pm CDT

# Abstract
This tutorial will teach attendees how to make fully reproducible, publication-ready tables for academic journals, public-facing talks and online displays. The strengths and weaknesses of popular table-making packages will be shown. After the guiding principles for table design are explained, attendees will learn how to build tables. The course will use a mixture of lecture and hands-on practice to produce beautiful tables that have already been published, and attendees will learn how to take these tables to the next level. Attendees will learn how to make both static and interactive tables during the tutorial topics, which include: quick descriptive statics with the table1 package; tables to support hypothesis testing with p-values using the gt with `gtsummary` packages; making complex tables which can be directly integrated using Microsoft Word with the `flextable` package; and making beautiful interactive tables with the `reactable` and `reactablefmtr` packages. The audience will also learn how to use the `rUM` package as a shortcut to building academic papers.

# Software 

If you can build packages on your machine, you can run the code below to download/install and or download/build packages.  If you don't know... you can use RStudio.Cloud.

## The Slides
The slides for this talk were created using the R `xaringan` package (version 0.24) with CSS help (ninjutsu.css, cssninja-scaffold.css, sydney.css).  Many thanks to:

# Extra Stuff

In the tutorial lecture I mentioned a couple additional topics that were missing links.  Here they are:

+ To check to make sure that your images are colorblind safe, try the [Coblis website](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).
+ For a checklist on publications, look at the [equator network website](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/).
